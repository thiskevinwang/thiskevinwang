<!-- Hi, I’m Kevin 🐑

Originally from the notorious town that is Palo Alto, I went to college for Jazz Performance at the New School for Jazz in New York. Making music never paid the bills but I luckily collided with the world of speciality coffee and worked as a barista.

Somewhere in the fray, I taught myself programming (If you want to hear more, we can grab a coffee :D), a friend dug my resume out of his workplace's garbage, and gave me a shot. A few years later, I'm happily thriving as a Web Engineer on the Digital Web Platform team at HashiCorp! (Checkout the new https://developer.hashicorp.com/waypoint/integrations page! — 🍻)

I work across the stack — frontends, CI/CD automation, backend API’s, persistence layers — but I have a particular interest in cloud platforms and tools of that nature.
