Hello, I'm Kevin!

I'm a forever-curious tinkerer that is excited by both new tech, as well as backfilling knowledge about classic design patterns (I come from a non-technical background, and have a degree in music performance ðŸ˜…)

I feel most at-home working on backend/edge/cloud _"turf"_, and reach for simple and elegant but pragmatic (above all else) solutions to problems.

## Current

Iâ€™m a Senior Engineer at [**Clerk**](https://clerk.com), working on problems that span our entire stack, with a focus on our backend and edge surface areas.

## Previously

Prior to Clerk, I was at...

[**HashiCorp**](https://hashicorp.com) as a _Web Platform Engineer_, where I focused on 2 big ships:
  1. Versioned docs - This was a complex, 4+ year long internal & enterprise ask, which was ultimately implemented with a GitHub App and event-driven ETL workflow, backed by AWS DynamoDB. This system is in use today, and supports all HashiCorp products' documentation. <sup>(Supporting)</sup>
  2. Developer AI â€” LLM/GPT-powered chat for docs and tutorials on https://developer.hashicorp.com, backed by Postgres, Azure AI, and a Node REST API. <sup>(Lead and sole engineer)</sup>

[**Capsule**](https://capsule.com) as a _Frontend Engineer_, where I primarily focused on the consumer-facing frontend and supported a AuthN/Z migration to AWS Cognito. <sup>(Supporting)</sup>
